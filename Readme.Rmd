Readme File : Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains my work for the course project for Getting and cleaning data.
The repo consists of 3 files:
1. This Readme file
2. The Code Book file "CodeBook.rmd" which explains the Rscript file workings and methodology
3. The Rscript file "run_analysis.R" which downlads the data, loads and transforms into the final tidy data result.

All that is required is to load the Rscript file, "run_analysis.R" modify the intial working directories and run the entire script. It will output the result in a file called "tidydatafinal.txt"

Please use the CodeBook file for detailed steps and explanations of the script file workings.
